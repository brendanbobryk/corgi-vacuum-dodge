# Corgi Vacuum Dodge 🐶🧹

A small Frogger-inspired React game where you guide a corgi safely across the floor while avoiding roaming vacuums to reach toys and treats at the top!  
This project was built as part of a daily game challenge to practice React fundamentals, game loops, collision detection, and grid-based movement.

## Features

- Grid-based movement using arrow keys
- Moving vacuum obstacles with lane-based speeds
- Collision detection that resets the corgi on contact
- Goal row filled with toys, plushies, and treats
- Score tracking for successful crossings
- Dark-themed, easy-on-the-eyes layout
- Simple, responsive game board

## Technologies Used

- React (with hooks)
- JavaScript
- CSS
